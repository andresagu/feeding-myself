# feeding-myself


This React Native app will be the ideal chef's assistant. This application will leverage [Spoonacular's Food API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) to deliver an intuitive UX for planning out meals to cook on the fly.

Having an endless cookbook on your phone makes access to delicious and fresh recipes a breeze but there are just so many out there, many of which are hard to parse, that we usually end up sticking to a select few. This is the problem xxx plans to solve by working to find recipes that are diverse, mold to what's in your fridge, and fit your schedule_
